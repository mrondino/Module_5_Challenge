Project Title: Module 5 Challenge

Description: In this project, we are analyzing pharmaceutical data off of trials to determine certain outcomes from specific drug regimens.

Getting Started: You will need to open the code in Jupyter Notebook code and have the CSV file ready in resources.

Code Source: For the the "Line and Scatter Plots" section, and the "Correlation and Regression" section, I utilized the code found in Week 5 Class 3 Activities: 09-Stu_Fits_and_Regression. I structed it similar to what I needed and changed the variables to match my code.

Author: The author for this project was me (Madeline Rondino)

Acknowledgements: Please reference "Code Source" above. I also utlized the "Xpert Learning Assistant" for recommendations on how to format this README file.
